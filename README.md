# HI_Meter
Wrote this to create a heat index meter to see what the temperature and Heat Index are at work.

The circuit design is fairly simple as most of the parts can be sourced from the kits that are usually included
with Arduino boards. The only piece that I bought seperately was the DHT22 from SparkFun.

# To Do:
Fritzing schematics to be added



Coded for the Arduino IDE 1.6.4
